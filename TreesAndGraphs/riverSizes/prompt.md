# River Sizes

## [Solution (JS)](./solution.js)

You are given a two-dimensional array (matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s. Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river. A river consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its size. Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. Note that these sizes do not need to be in any particular order.

### Example

```
Sample Input:
[
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
]

Sample Output:
[1, 2, 2, 2, 5]
```
