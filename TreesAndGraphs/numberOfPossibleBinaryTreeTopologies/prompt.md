# Number of Possible Binary Tree Topologies

## [Solution (JS)](./solution.js)

Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer n and that returns the number of possible Binary Tree topologies that can be created with exactly n nodes. A Binary Tree topology is defined as any Binary Tree configuration, irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist only two Binary Tree topologies when n is equal to 2: a root node with a left node, and a root node with a right node. Node that when n is equal to 0, there is one topology that can be created: the None (null) node.
