# Palindrome Partitioning Min Cuts

## [Solution (JS)](./solution.js)

Given a non-empty string, write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to perform on the string such that each remaining substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is defined as a string that is written the same forward as backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

```
Sample Input:  'noonabbad'
Sample Output: 2 ('noon' | 'abba' | 'd')
```
