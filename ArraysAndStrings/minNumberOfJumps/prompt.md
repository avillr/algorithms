# Minimum Number of Jumps

## [Solution (JS)](./solution.js)

You are given a non-empty array of integers. Each element represents the maximum number of steps you can take forward. For example, if the element at index 1 is 3, you can go from index 1 to index 2, 3, or 4. Write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the final index. Note that jumping from index i to index i + x always constitutes 1 jump, no matter how large x is.
